              I love to draw and paint in my free time! Watercolor is my
              favorite right now. I also enjoy day hiking in the PNW and
              spending time petting as many dogs as I can.

            <h4>Website Management and Digital Media</h4>
            <p>
              My first priority at Serene Remodeling was to update the company
              website using their current web host, Wix. The original site was
              dated and was not responsive to different screen sizes. I used a
              simple premade layout as a base to build the website to look more
              modern and easy to navigate. We decided to keep to the WYSIWYG
              system for ease of editing by the owners who are not familiar with
              HTML/CSS. To see a live view of Serene Remodeling's Website,

            </p>
            <p>
              As new jobs were completed I was tasked to stage, take photos, and
              then create each portfolio page for each project. Projects ranged
              from small powder bathrooms to full house renovations. I then
              would upload and add our projects to Houzz, an online community
              based around themes such as construction and interior design.
            </p>
            <h4>Working with Clients</h4>
            <p>
              Another important aspect of my job was helping clients pick
              materials for their projects. I worked closely with clients at
              various showrooms, guiding them to materials that would suit both
              their style and budget. Educating them on their options, and
              seeking out solutions to unique design problems.

            <h4>Developing a Brand Identity</h4>

            <p>
              This personal project started as a poster design for a fake event
              that could also be used for other promotional products. I chose to
              do a Seattle Reptile Expo.
            </p>
            <p>
              I first researched reptiles that are native to the PNW for
              inspiration. I chose the pacific ring-necked snake, due to its
              striking red and black pattern. ‍
            </p>
            <p>
              The illustration is simple and graphic. I wanted the shape and
              color to be the main focus. The snake can be altered in different
              lengths to fit different marketing materials.
            </p>
            <p>
              Overall I wanted the poster to have a professional look for the
              event, but also be family-friendly and welcoming. Using minimal
              but bold colors keeps the design clean, and the snake graphic
              helps grab your attention.
            </p>
            <h4>Developing a Website</h4>
            <p>
              After creating the event’s marketing materials, I wanted to create
              a mockup of what the website might look like for this event. I
              incorporated many elements from the original poster design,
              including the winding black snake, dark greys, and a similar font.
              I selected colorful photos of reptiles and put a slight red
              overlay on them to unify the look.
            </p>
            <p>
              Finally, I wanted to create a working example of how the winding
              snake would work using HTML and CSS. I first made a 3 column
              flexbox to hold the whole "snake". I then placed in the 2nd column
              a div container with a grid. This allowed me to place the bends of
              the snake. The bends were then created using two divs stacked on
              each other, and using a curved radius to give the illusion that
              the snake is all connected.
            </p>
